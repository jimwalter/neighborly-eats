# Neighborly Eats Local Restaurant Recommendation Application

## App Available:
* [Neighborly Eats](https://neighborly-eats.herokuapp.com/)

---

### Background
* This app was designed and created with a strict three day timeline to produce a minimum viable product from scratch. My hope is that people will use it to find nearby restaurants to order take out and help support local restaurants during the Coronavirus pandemic.

### Features
* Utilizes user input for location and food type to make relavent recommendations.
